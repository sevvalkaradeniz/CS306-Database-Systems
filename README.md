<h1 align="center">Music Storage and Support System :notes:</h1>

This project includes a database system that helps storing informations about songs, artists, albums, instruments, awards, managers and song writers. 

It covers many relations between these entities such as songs and the artists that perform them, songs and songwriters, instruments used in the songs...

Needless to say, it allows adding new data, removing, filtering and deleting from all the tables.

As an added bonus, it includes a special support page where the users can open tickets to the admins regarding various issues. Users can ask admins for song recommendations, ask about the song background and make suggestions about the system.
